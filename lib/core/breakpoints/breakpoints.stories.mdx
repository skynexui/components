# Breakpoints

Right now we have the following Breakpoints for you use when passing down your styles:

* `xs` - for extra small devices (mobile phones)
* `sm` - for small (mobile phones and tablets)
* `md` - for medium devices (tablets, desktops and notebooks)
* `lg` - for large desktops
* `xl` - for extra large desktops 

<Box
  styleSheet={{
    marginVertical: '16px',
    padding: '16px',
    backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5',
  }}
>
  <pre>
    {JSON.stringify(breakpoints, null, 2)}
  </pre>
</Box>


## Flutter Example
- Inside your component, just pass a prop styleSheet with a Map with `Breakpoints.xs` or any other valid breakpoint to apply an style to that resolution

> It's mandatory fill the `xs` key with a valid value, otherwise it will not work

```dart
Box(
  styleSheet: StyleSheet(
    width: {Breakpoints.xs: '550'},
    height: {Breakpoints.xs: '550'},
    backgroundColor: {Breakpoints.xs: '#ff6a00', Breakpoints.sm: '#006a00'},
  ),
),
```

## JavaScript Example
- Inside your component, just pass a prop styleSheet with a Map with `xs` (`Breakpoints prefix is optional`) or any other valid breakpoint to apply an style to that resolution

> It's mandatory fill the `xs` key with a valid value, otherwise it will not work, you can pass the value directly also as in plain HTML

```js
<Box
  styleSheet={{
    width: {xs: '550px'},
    height: {xs: '550px'},
    backgroundColor: {xs: '#ff6a00', sm: '#006a00'},
    border: '1px solid red',
  }}
/>
```
